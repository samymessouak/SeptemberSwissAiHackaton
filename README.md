# Welcome to "AI for Resilience against Extreme Weather Events" by Swiss Re
This respository is part of the Zurich hackathon of [Swiss {ai} Week](https://swiss-ai-weeks.ch/) happening on 26/27 September 2025.

## Introduction
The recent tragedy of glacier collapse in Blatten and the increasing summer heatwaves underscore the vulnerabilities in the Swiss Alps. In this evolving risk landscape, the reinsurance industry plays a crucial role in helping societies understand and manage the financial impact of natural disasters such as landslides, floods, and heatwaves.  

AI-driven technologies open up new opportunities for the (re)insurance industry to take societal responsibility in responding to natural catastrophes. With this hackathon, Swiss Re aims to explore innovative ways to turn these opportunities into concrete solutions that enhance resilience and create tangible benefits for society. 

This document provides an overview of Swiss Re's hack challenge and potential solution designs, risk and insurance inputs for better scoping and pointers to datasets and other resources that you can leverage.  

# Hackathon Challenge 
Welcome to the Hackathon on **AI for Resilience against Extreme Weather Events**!  The aim of this challenge is to use data and technology to enable Swiss society to build resilience to extreme weather events. You are encouraged to design any solution that contributes to this goal. The ideas below illustrate some possible directions you might pursue, yet you are just as welcome to think beyond them and propose something entirely new: 

Your solutions might include:
- **Innovative Parametric Insurance Solutions**: Design and prototype a parametric insurance model with innovative trigger mechanism based on real-time environmental data (e.g. extreme temperature index). Simulate payout scenarios based on historical or synthetically created datasets. The payout does not need to be financial - think of what would bring instant relief to society, e.g. during a heatwave! 
- **AI-Powered Early Warning Systems**: Thinking of individuals living or travelling through Switzerland, design and prototype an AI-powered application enabling to better apprehend selected risks (e.g., landslides or glacier collapses) and issuing warnings or relevant mitigation recommendations based on the user location. The AI model should be able to leverage multimodal data ranging from weather to topological data and assume the user's location as known. 
- **Intelligent Disaster Response Systems**: Prototype a platform for real-time disaster coordination with integration of open source exposure data and optimized resource allocation in case of a disaster. Conduct damage assessment of natural hazards (e.g., floods, hail, windstorms, precipitation) on properties from street view or satellite imagery. The tool should help identify where the most significant losses/damage might occur. For example, in areas with high concentration of rooftop solar panels, older and more vulnerable buildings, or other exposure characteristics that increase susceptibility to damage.   
- **Any other solutions**: Be creative and feel free to think and build completely out of the box!

## Risk Inputs for Scoping
Swiss communities face a wide range of natural hazards, each with different impacts on people and health, property, and agriculture.  

### Hazard / Exposure mapping (risk scenarios) 
The table below provides examples of how selected hazards can affect these areas of exposure. While not exhaustive, it illustrates the variety of risks and consequences across lines of business. To make your solution both relevant and feasible, we recommend focusing on one specific hazard-exposure intersection which represents a concrete risk scenario, e.g., floods × property damage or hail × agriculture. 

| Hazards ↓ / Exposures → | People & Health                          | Property damage                                                                 | Agriculture                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Flood**               | Evacuation, injuries, fatalities         | Property (buildings) & infrastructure damage (Power grid, bridges, roads, railway lines) | Crop loss, forest loss                      |
| **Windstorm**           | Injuries, fatalities                     | Property (buildings) & infrastructure damage (Power grid), road blockages from trees | Crop loss, forest loss                      |
| **Convective storms (hail)** | Injuries, fatalities                | Property (buildings, solar panels) damage, motor damage                         | Crop loss depending on the growing season   |
| **Earthquakes** (not climate-driven but relevant in Switzerland) | Injuries, fatalities | Property (buildings) & infrastructure damage (Power grid, bridges, roads, railway lines) | Crop loss, forest loss through indirect impacts e.g. landslides |
| **Landslides**          | Injuries, fatalities                     | Property (buildings) & infrastructure damage (Power grid, bridges, roads, railway lines) | Crop loss, forest loss                      |
| **Drought**             | Water shortage                           | Property & infrastructure damage from subsidence depending on the soil conditions | Crop loss, forest dieback                   |
| **Heat wave**           | Health issues                            | Power grid failures, potentially affecting other infrastructures                | Crop loss, forest dieback                   |

## Guide to Approach the Challenge
To help you structure your work during the hackathon, we suggest the following four steps. These are not mandatory but can serve as a practical guide to move efficiently from problem statement to solution and pitch within the sprint timeframe. 

 
**1. Scope the Problem**
- Identify the hazard–exposure intersection you want to address. 
- Clarify the type of threat, the potential loss or impact, and the geographic focus. 
- Bring in your own observations, domain expertise, and lived experience to sharpen the problem framing. 

**2. Design Your Solution**
- Define who your persona is (e.g., municipality, household, insurer, hiker) and how they would use the product. 
- Consider the role of AI and data: what sources are available, what’s feasible in 36 hours, and what’s innovative. 
- Sketch a mock-up or conceptual design of your solution to make it tangible. 

**3. Prototype**
- Build a working model using real or synthetic datasets. 
- Perform basic validation to ensure plausibility. 
- Make your assumptions explicit (e.g., thresholds, triggers, coverage). 
- Implement a simple dashboard, app, or platform to demonstrate functionality. 

**4. Prepare the Pitch and Submission**
- Summarize your work in a clear slide deck. 
- Use storytelling to explain the problem, solution, and societal impact.
